# Face Detection Android App

This is a simple face detection app using the OpenCV library.
It was developed as an internship project.

This app can be used hand in hand with the [Face Clustering app](https://evcs.photoprintit.lan/maic/face-clustering-praktikumsprojekt).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The open-source OpenCV library for Android
```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Usage

This app writes a text files containing info about the faces bounding boxes.
This file can be shared to the [Face Clustering app](https://evcs.photoprintit.lan/maic/face-clustering-praktikumsprojekt) in order to perform clustering of the faces.
